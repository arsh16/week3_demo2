    <p class="descriptionOfProjects">
        The website was built by me in my first semester of Software Engineering when I was studing basic Web Interface Design Course for begineers. I used just HTML and CSS to built this page. It is a business website of a real estate agent. There are four pages: Home, Active listing, Site Map, and Contact us page. The home page contains mission statement, areas served and clients' reviews. The active listing page contains list of all the houses that are for sale. The contact page allows user to send their queries.
