    <p class="descriptionOfProjects">
        The website was built by me in my first semester of Software Engineering when I was studing basic Web Interface Course for begineers. I used just HTML and CSS to built this page. It is a business website of a real estate agent. There are four pages: Home, Active listing, Site Map, and Contact us page.
